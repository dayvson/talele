#Why Talele?

I was inspired to create Talele by my 4 year old son, who said he wanted to play a jigsaw puzzle with family pictures. The name itself is the name of his imaginary friend.



#What is Talele?

Talele is an iOS jigsaw puzzle game. It allows a user to select pictures from their photo library in order to create an infinite number of jigsaw puzzles. Once a picture is selected the user chooses from three levels: Easy (12 pieces), Normal (24 pieces), and Hard (48 pieces).


#Who is Talele for?

Talele is designed for children with the main aim of having fun with pictures and a sub-aim of building cognitive (problem-solving) and emotional (patience) skills. This game can be played in English, Portuguese, and Spanish to help children learn about navigation and discover new words through audio and text.
Imagine that your son or daughter asks to create a puzzle of their favorite cartoon or superhero. Talele makes it so simple! Search for the image online and save the photo in your personal library. Voi la, you have your very own Talele game.
